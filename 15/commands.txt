--> Create a kubernetes cluster with virtualbox as hypervisor.
minikube start --driver=virtualbox
minikube config set driver virtualbox

--> List master processes running inside minikube
minikube status
kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system -l component=kube-apiserver

--> Find how many nodes are there in the cluster and the roles of each node.
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get nodes -o wide

--> role(s) of each node
1. Master Node - consists of 4 processes
    API server - The API server is the front end for the Kubernetes control plane
    Scheduler - decides where to schedule the application in the worker nodes
    Controller - detects state change
    Etcd - key value store
2. Worker Node - consists of 3 necessary process
    Container runtime - like docker
    Kubectl - interaction between node and container
    Kubeproxy - forwards request from services to pod

--> Delete kubernetes cluster
minikube delete
